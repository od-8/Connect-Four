# Connect-Four
## How to play
Connect four is game where to people play against each other and try to get 4 coins in a row. Like Naughts and Crosses
however you can't just place them in any position, they have to fall into position on a row. 

## How I made this game
I created this game following TDD principals and used rspec for all testing. It runs on the command line and was written with ruby.

## Why
I made this game for the Connect Four Project which is part of the Odin Project course. 
It will help me learn TDD and improve my skills and understanding of fundamentals.
